/**
 * M-Copilot - an AI co-driver for BMW iDrive 7 that answers with this car's own data.
 *
 *   - One screen: the phone pairing QR code until an AI key is paired, then the co-driver.
 *   - Pairing over the internet (ntfy relay, end-to-end encrypted with the car's own key): the phone
 *     page sends the AI key, and optionally the owner's car profile (model, tune, mods, tyres, fuel).
 *   - 24 topic chips in 4 categories, worded for a stock daily car as well as a tuned one:
 *       CHECK     health check, warning lights / fault memory, service due, tyres, brakes, 12 V battery
 *       DRIVE     ready for full power, fuel and range, weather grip, how was that drive, running hot, cool-down
 *       PERFORM   launch, track day prep, tune health, heat soak, gearbox and clutch load, mods
 *       KNOW-HOW  oil spec, gearbox care, fuel and octane, known weak points, due at this mileage, trip prep
 *     plus an on-screen keyboard for any question (follow-up questions keep the context).
 *   - What the AI is told (ai.js buildVehicleContext): only what the car reported - live driving
 *     signals, temperatures, tyres, fuel, odometer, the cluster's service list, the fault memory
 *     when asked about - and who the car is (vehicle.js: make, model year and type from the VIN,
 *     engine and gearbox unit types, the owner's profile). Anything unknown is said to be unknown.
 *   - Read-only. Signals are passive subscriptions, only while the screen is shown. Diagnostic reads
 *     (fault memory, VIN / unit types once) run only when a question needs them and only while the car
 *     is in a steady state: never while the engine is starting or the car is shutting down.
 *   - Foreground only: signals, pairing polls and timers stop when the screen is left.
